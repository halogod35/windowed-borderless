# windowed-borderless
[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) cannot capture games running in fullscreen mode or with Vulkan. The solution for this is to run the applications in windowed borderless mode. However, some of these applications do not have windowed borderless. This script fixes the problem by "centering" a windowed program by offsetting the application to (-3, -26) on your screen.

## Usage
Download/clone to wherever

Run the script

Press F11 in a windowed program to center it
